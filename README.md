# EntityFrameworkCore 3.1.25 (Net Standard 2.0)
Pack of needed DLLs to work with EntityFrameworkCore 3.1.25. The version 3.1.25 is old, but it supported by Unity 2019 - 2020. If you want to use EntityFrameworkCore 5.0.0 you have to use Unity 2021 or newer, this pack of DLLs won't work in that case. Need to use another one.
