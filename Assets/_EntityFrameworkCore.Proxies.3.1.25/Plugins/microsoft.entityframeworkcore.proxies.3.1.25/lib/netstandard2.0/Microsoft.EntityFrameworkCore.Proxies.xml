                    Adds the services required for proxy support in Entity Framework. You use this method when
                    using dependency injection in your application, such as with ASP.NET. For more information
                    on setting up dependency injection, see http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=526890.

                    You only need to use this functionality when you want Entity Framework to resolve the services it uses
                    from an external dependency injection container. If you are not using an external
                    dependency injection container, Entity Framework will take care of creating the services it requires.
